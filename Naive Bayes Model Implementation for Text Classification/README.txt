STEPS TO RUN THE CODE:

1.GET INSIDE MY FOLDER DIRECTORY

2.FROM THE TERMINAL , JUST GIVE "make" --THIS WILL AUTOMATICALLY RUN MY CODE 
(I had created a make file with the command to run my code for easy access, so just by giving "make" in the terminal from my directory path, the code will run)

3.FIRST THIS CODE WILL RUN TO TEST THE ACCURACY OF BOTH TRAIN AND TEST DATA BEFORE FILTERING. NEXT , IN ORDER TO CHECK THE ACCURACY OF TRAIN/TEST DATA AFTER FILTERING, YOU MUST HAVE TO GO TO "my accuracy.py" FILE AND THEN CHANGE "stop_words = 1" . THIS VARIABLE WOULD BE SET TO '0 INITIALLY. NOW IF WE WANT TO TEST FOR ACCURACY AFTER FILTERING, WE HAVE TO CHANGE IT TO '1'

4.AFTER 3RD STEP, ACCURACY FOR BOTH TEST/TRAIN DATA -BEFORE AND AFTER FILTERING OF STOP WORDS WOULD BE CAPTURED.

5.AS YOU RUN THE CODE, YOU COULD SEE ALL THE RESULTS IN "results.txt"
