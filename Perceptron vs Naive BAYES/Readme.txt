STEPS TO RUN MY PROGRAM:
1- I have created a "makefile" for this assignment.
2- So simply by typing "make" in the terminal, my program will run and will show the output in the terminal itself.
3- The default execution is with stop words. So if you give "make" for the first time, you can see all the accuracies for the text "with stop words"
4- If you want to check for accuracies "without stopwords" , then change "stopword = 1" in "Snehaa_Sivakumar.py" . Now again give "make" in the terminal, and then you can see the accuracies for the text "without stopwords".

NOTE  :-- YOU HAVE TO WAIT A COUPLE OF MINUTES FOR YOU TO SEE THE OUTPUT IN THE TERMINAL.
SO AFTER GIVING "MAKE", KINDLY WAIT 2 MINUTES, THEN YOU CAN SEE THE ACCURACIES LISTING DOWN ONE BY ONE IN THE TERMINAL.


NOTE  :-- I have captured all the accuracies in the "RESULTS" folder
